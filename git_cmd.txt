*** Inroduction to GIT ***

Git is a version control system. 

Advantages:
- Roll back is easy
- Individuals can work on the same project and contibute there work independently

Stages in git:

untracked -- unmodified -- modified -- staging -- commit

.gitignore : make a txt file with name .gitignore and add all the file names or types of file name that we don't want to track

GIT commands:

git init: initialize a git repo
rm -rf .git : deleting the complete git repo
git status: check the status of working git repo
git add --a: add files to staging area
git commit -m "-----msg-----" : commit the changes made
git clone url file_name : Clone a git repo
git diff : provide changes between the staged file and working directory
git diff --staged: provide changes from last commit and current staged files
git commit -a -m "----msg----" : direct commit
git rm filename : delete file from git and system
git rm filename --cached : delete file from git only
git mv filename new_filename : rename a file
git log : provide the log's
git log --pretty=short/oneline/long : provide log's
git log --since=2.days : provide logs of last 2 days, same can be varied for different time durations
git log -p -n : provide last n log's
git log --stat : provide the changes a a commit
git checkout --filename : roll back to previous file state
git checkout -f : roll back all files to previous state
git checkout -b branch_name : create a new branch
git checkout branch_name : move to that branch
git branch : show all the branches
git push origin branch_name : push the branch 
git merge branch_name: merge the branch to master
git branch -d branch_name: delete a branch

Creating a remote repo : 

1.go to github
2.create a blank repo with the name desired
3.clone the repo
4.add the files to the new folder created
5.make the changes if required in the files
6.then add and commit
7.push
8.go to 5

Working on someone else's repo:

1.go to github repo
2.fork the repo
3.Step 4 of above explanation and continue
4.Create a pull request (Now the owner of the repo checks for the changes made and can approve to merge the same or not)

*Commit the changes done in a branch before moving to another branch
